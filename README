See Hiveminder headers as columns in your Thunderbird message list.

To run this extension out of git, simply checkout the repo into

    ~/.thunderbird/default.<random>/extensions/hiveminder-columns@tsibley.net/

and restart Thunderbird.


CAVEATS

Unfortunately, you need to tell Thunderbird to index non-standard
message headers in the local message store, otherwise the values aren't
available.

By setting the mailnews.customDBHeaders option (in the Advanced Config editor) to

    x-hiveminder-due x-hiveminder-tags x-hiveminder-recordlocator x-hiveminder-group x-priority

you'll make the most useful Hiveminder headers indexed for all new mail.
Existing mail will not be reindexed unless you remove and readd the mail
account or manually remove the folder's .msf files under the relevant
IMAP accounts.

Maybe in the future I'll find a way to have the extension force a
reindex.
